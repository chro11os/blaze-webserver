üî• Blaze Webserver

A blazingly fast, lightweight, and modern web server built from scratch in Rust, with a relentless focus on performance and memory safety.
üöß Project Status: Work in Progress üöß

Blaze is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use.

This project started as an effort to build a high-performance web server from the ground up, leveraging Rust's unique advantages for systems programming. The primary goal is to learn and explore low-level networking, concurrency, and HTTP protocol implementation while creating something genuinely fast.
‚ú® Features

    Built in pure Rust: For memory safety, concurrency, and performance.

    Asynchronous Architecture: Built on top of tokio for non-blocking I/O to handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.

    HTTP/1.1 Parsing: Basic request parsing from raw TCP streams.

    Static File Serving: Capable of serving static files from a root directory.

    (Planned) Thread Pool for Request Handling: To efficiently manage CPU-bound tasks.

    (Planned) Extensible Middleware: A simple system to add custom logic to the request-response cycle.

üéØ Goals

The ultimate goal for Blaze is to be a minimalist yet powerful web server that can compete with established servers in performance benchmarks for static file serving and simple API requests. Key objectives include:

    Raw Speed: To achieve a high requests-per-second count with low latency.

    Low Memory Footprint: To be as resource-efficient as possible.

    Security: To leverage Rust's type and memory safety to prevent common vulnerabilities.

    Learning: To serve as a comprehensive learning project for anyone interested in Rust and networking.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Rust toolchain (latest stable version recommended): https://rustup.rs/

Running the Server

    Clone the repository:

    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/blaze-webserver.git](https://github.com/your-username/blaze-webserver.git)
    cd blaze-webserver

    Run in development mode:

    cargo run

By default, the server will start on 127.0.0.1:8080 and serve files from a local public directory. You can test it by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080.

ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are highly welcome! This project is a great place to learn about Rust and web technologies. Feel free to open an issue to discuss a new feature or submit a pull request.

As a fellow developer from the Philippines, I'm excited to see what we can build. Let's make something fast!
